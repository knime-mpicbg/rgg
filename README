RGG is a GUI generator for R scripts.

This repository is dnot (yet) linked to the official development, but is an independent branch
which fixes certain bugs and adds some features like:

- no rgghome on top of each script
- instantiate rgg from xml-string and not from file
- persistable and restorable dialog-configurations
- fixed invalid comma when using listbox-widget
- cleaner build-system and reorganized dependencies
- more advanced ui-elements like a two-pane-selector (that optionally keeps the order of the selection)
- reimplemented RGGRunner, which is now bundled with the library
- rgg.jar is now executable (by simply opening a rgg-runner instance)
- new labelarea-element, which allows to display longer descriptions and keeps all line-breaks and text-indentation

Check out available RGG elements and their syntax on the [Wiki-Page](https://github.com/knime-mpicbg/rgg/wiki)
